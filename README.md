## Overview and Goals
We are Mod 2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. In this project we were tasked to build an application displaying information about multiple users in a meaningful way.

Fit Lit tracks user health and fitness information for a given week  and can display the information across multiple screens.  

Data such as daily hydration consumption, step goals and minutes active are displayed on the dashboard. The dashboard also displays the averages for the user's friends for a given day.

The charts page offers graphical representation of user statistics  from the previous week.



### Goals

``` Markdown
_ Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way on multiple screens
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD


```
